  <h2>About Laralyn</h2>

  <p id="aboutText" style="display:none;">
    Hi! I’m Laralyn Mendoza, 19 years old, currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), and I live in Sitio Laray, Barangay Boroc, Ormoc City. I have a deep passion for music and dance, and in my free time, I enjoy playing online games, sports (especially futsal), and traveling, especially to beaches where I can relax and enjoy the scenery. I’m someone who can vibe with anyone, making it easy for me to connect with different kinds of people, and I love anything with pearls, especially milk tea. I come from a small, loving, and supportive family. My mother, Glenda S. Mendoza, 52, is caring and always motivates me in my studies and activities. My father, Nilo P. Mendoza, 57, works as a farm guard in Ormoc Farm Incorporated and has taught me the value of perseverance and hard work. I have a sister, Shaira Mae S. Mendoza, 26, a culinary student at EVSU Ormoc, and a one-year-old nephew, Elmo Reigh P. Solano, who lives with us due to family circumstances.

I am a recent graduate of Ipil National High School under the General Academic Strand, where I was a high honor student throughout my years. I actively participated in school activities, including the Campus Youth Ministry, and ran for SSLG President, which, although I did not win, helped me improve my communication skills and overcome my fear of public speaking. Some of my achievements include being a consistent high honor student, earning an NC II Certification in Customer Service (TESDA), serving as YES-O President, and being an active choir member in both school and parish.

I am eager to learn, ambitious, and determined to achieve my dreams. I also have a loving, caring, and supportive boyfriend, who always encourages me, shares my dreams, and makes even the simplest moments fun and meaningful. I am grateful for my family, my experiences, and the opportunities that continue to help me grow both personally and academically. 
Since I was a kid, I have always loved sports, music, dancing, and even online games. In elementary school, I joined various sports like volleyball, running, and basketball because I found them enjoyable and exciting.

When I was in high school, someone invited me to try futsal. At that time, I had no idea what futsal was, but since I loved sports, I gave it a try. I started playing in Grade 8 and quickly fell in love with the sport. I participated in different competitions and even joined the futsal team in the EVSU intramurals.

Aside from futsal, I also played basketball in high school. During a youth camp, someone encouraged me to join the basketball team. Even though I wasn’t very skilled at basketball, I still joined because I enjoyed the game.

I also have a passion for dancing. I became a member of various dance clubs in Ormoc City, including The Vibe Dynasty. Through dancing, I had the opportunity to travel to different places, meet new friends, and gain valuable experiences. I even competed in several dance competitions, even though I wasn’t the best dancer.

When it comes to music, I love singing even though I joke that music doesn’t love me back haha. Singing brings me joy and comfort, so I joined the choir in Ipil. I became a choir member of the Ipil National Youth Ministry and also sang for the Ipil Parish. I also love singing with friends.

Aside from all these, I also enjoy playing online games in my free time. Gaming helps me relax, have fun, and even connect with friends.
